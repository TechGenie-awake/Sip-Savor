## üéØ Problem Statement

Many businesses and freelancers struggle to collect, manage, and showcase authentic customer testimonials effectively. Existing solutions are either too rigid or require manual updates on their websites every time a testimonial changes. There is a need for an easy-to-use platform where users can create, customize, and automatically embed testimonials and collect feedback from visitors in real-time.

## üí° Proposed Solution

Develop a web application where users can create custom testimonials with personalized designs and generate a small embed code to insert on their own websites. The platform will also provide a feedback submission widget embedded alongside the testimonials to gather new reviews directly from site visitors. All data is stored and managed centrally, allowing users to update testimonials once and have those updates reflected instantly everywhere.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Custom Testimonial Builder**: Creation tool with customizable templates and styling options
