## üéØ Problem Statement

Home cooks and cocktail enthusiasts struggle to find quality recipes across multiple platforms. They need to switch between different apps for food recipes and cocktail instructions, leading to a fragmented cooking and mixing experience. Users lack a centralized place to save their favorite recipes, plan meals with available ingredients, and discover new culinary creations.

## üí° Proposed Solution

**Sip & Savor** is a unified mobile application that brings together food recipes and cocktail recipes in one elegant platform. Leveraging the Spoonacular API for food recipes and TheCocktailDB API for drink recipes, users can search, discover, save, and organize their favorite recipes with intelligent filters and personalized collections.
